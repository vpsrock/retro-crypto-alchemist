# 🧪 PHASE 1 TESTING GUIDE

## 🚨 SERVER DEPLOYMENT FIX

**Run these commands on your server to resolve the git divergence:**

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project directory
cd ~/retro-crypto-alchemist

# 2. Check current status
git status

# 3. Reset to match remote master (safe approach)
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master

# 4. Clean any untracked files
git clean -fd

# 5. Verify successful sync
git log --oneline -3
```

**Expected output after step 5:**
```
040ec70 feat(multi-tp): Phase 1 - Foundation Enhancement Implementation
07d1531 fix(scheduler): correct position size calculation to match manual trading
5eadb81 fix(scheduler): filter only truly open positions...
```

## 🧪 PHASE 1 TESTING SEQUENCE

### **1. Build Verification Test**
```bash
# On server after git sync
npm run build
```
**Expected:** ✅ Successful build with no errors

### **2. Database Migration Test**
```bash
# Test database schema updates
node test-database-migrations.js
```
**Expected Output:**
- ✅ Database initialized successfully
- ✅ Multi-TP order details updated successfully
- ✅ Multi-TP position retrieval working
- ✅ All new columns created successfully

### **3. Multi-TP Logic Test**
```bash
# Test multi-TP strategy logic (without real API calls)
node test-phase1-multi-tp.js
```
**Expected Output:**
- ✅ Multi-TP Strategy Test: PASSED
- ✅ Order size calculations working
- ✅ Price level calculations working
- ✅ Fallback logic for small positions working

### **4. Live API Integration Test**
Only run this with real API keys and small amounts!

```bash
# Start the application
npm run dev
```

**Test with manual trading UI:**
1. Navigate to trading interface
2. Analyze a contract (e.g., BTC_USDT)
3. Set trade size to $10 USD
4. Execute trade using new Multi-TP strategy
5. Monitor position in dashboard

### **5. Scheduler Integration Test**
```bash
# Create a test scheduler job with small trade size
# Use the scheduler UI to create a job with:
# - Trade Size: $5 USD (small for testing)
# - Confidence Threshold: 90% (high to avoid accidental trades)
# - Interval: 1h (infrequent for testing)
```

## 🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIORS

### **✅ For Positions ≥ 5 Contracts:**
- Uses Multi-TP strategy
- Creates 3 orders: TP1, TP2, SL
- Database shows `strategyType: 'multi-tp'`
- Enhanced monitoring every 30 seconds

### **✅ For Positions < 5 Contracts:**
- Automatically falls back to Single TP
- Creates 2 orders: TP, SL
- Database shows `strategyType: 'single'`
- Normal monitoring every 2 minutes

### **✅ Database Enhancements:**
- 13 new columns added seamlessly
- Existing positions unaffected
- New positions track multi-TP state
- Helper functions operational

### **✅ Scheduler Enhancements:**
- Uses multi-TP by default
- Enhanced monitoring active
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Time-based exits (4-hour limit)

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Git Divergence**
**Solution:** Use the server deployment fix above

### **Issue: Build Errors**
**Check:**
- Node.js version compatibility
- Package dependencies updated
- TypeScript compilation issues

### **Issue: Database Migration Fails**
**Check:**
- Database file permissions
- SQLite version compatibility
- Disk space available

### **Issue: API Key Errors**
**Check:**
- Gate.io API keys properly configured
- API permissions include futures trading
- Rate limits not exceeded

### **Issue: Small Positions Not Working**
**Expected:** Positions < 5 contracts should automatically use single TP
**Check:** Log output for fallback messages
